  <strong>PROHIBITED & RESTRICTED ITEMS</strong> 
</div>

<p>Shipper agrees that its Shipment is acceptable for transportation and is deemed unacceptable if: it is classified as hazardous material, dangerous goods, prohibited or restricted articles by IATA (International Air Transport Association), ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation), ADR (Euro­pean Road Transport Regulation on dangerous goods), any applicable government department or other relevant organisation.<br><br>

Many items which appear harmless in everyday use can pose dangers on air and or road transport and are consequently forbidden for transport.<br>
In the UK the CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) is the governing body responsible for compliance of these rules. Failure to follow requirements may endanger the aircraft, its occupants and result in the prosecution of the person responsible under the Air Navigation (Dangerous Goods) Regulations.<br><br>

<h3 style="color:white;text-align:center;background-color:black"><marquee>The following goods are classified as DANGEROUS and not permitted</marquee></h3><br>

Goods travelling by 'Cargo' are subject to different restriction to those travelling as carry on luggage, as checked baggage (at the airport) or carried on your person at the flight. All items that travel by air are X-Rayed screened to check for compliance. If you have contravened these regulations and such items are found in your shipment, your shipment will be halted and you will be charged a fee by the airline handling agent or consolidator and the shipment will continue to be delayed until such charges have been paid in full. You will also incure a 5,000 Rs administration penalty.
